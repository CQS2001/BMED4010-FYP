#ddG_Binding
This section contains the files for investigating the ddG_Binding
The file KO_integrated.txt contains the GFP knockout value on day 14 for each SaCas9 variant, the first 52 values are for sgRNA ON1 while the rest of them are for sgRNA ON2
The file mutant_integrated.txt contains the mutant types on day 14 for each SaCas9 variant, the first 52 values are for sgRNA ON1 while the rest of them are for sgRNA ON2
The file SaCas9_KO&Mutant_generator.py is the python file for filtering the KO value on day 14 and generate the mutant file for each variants
The file mutant_fitness_curated.csv contains the empirical fitness data for SaCas9, it comes from the NAR paper: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1291
