# Mimilator Introduction

## What is _Mimilator_?
_**Mimilator**_ stands for Mimicking and Simulator. The _in silico_ protein engineering involves natural evolution mimicking and simulation of wet-lab experiments, which is exactly what _Mimilator_ is doing. As the processing of _EvoEF_ involves extensive command line input, which is absolutely cumbersome for highthroughput data operation, the automatic computation pipeline _Mimilator_ was constructed to reduce the laborious burden. By simply type in some commands, tons of computations and analysis can be performed and integrated.

## What can _Mimilator_ do?
_**Mimilator**_ can do the following things:
- **Predict the change in structural stability** of a protein or protein complex (in PDB file) after introducing the mutation.
- **Predict the change in binding affinity** of a protein-protein complex after introducing the mutation.
The detailed user manual can be refered to the file _**User manual**_
